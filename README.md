## Notes
Tasks are in the tasks folder. Some tasks build upon each other, but each task has a starting template in it so that you can start from any task.
You can replace the template with the solution from a previous task if you want to work in order.

## Tasks
There are 10 tasks of varying difficulty. They are not necessarily in order of difficulty, but some build on each other.

Task 4-7 are related to each other, and task 8-10 are related to each other.
